# Day 6

## objects

- objects allow us to group multiple values together
- once we make an object we can assign it to a variable
- we can then update the object from the variable
- we can also add new properties to the object

## objects in arrays

- one of the most useful data types in js is an array of objects
- revisiting our shopping cart
- array of objects with arrays in the object!

## exercise

- update your coffee shop site shopping cart to use objects
- you should have a name, price, and quantity for each item
- if an item is already in the cart, you should update the quantity when they click the add to cart button again
