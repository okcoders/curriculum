# Day 1

## High level overview, much of the code today should not be understood and will be covered in more detail later

- order in html vs. css vs. js
- responsibilities of each
- js is for adding event handling and dynamic content to html
- what are some examples of dynamic content or events?
- connecting and adding scripts to html
- the console
- do something or store something per line (multi-line later)
- program execution
- variables, types, and operators
- when we are in the browser, there are all sorts of apis available to us: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API - we interact with these with javascript
- for example, we can prompt, and we can get elements on the page to update
