- boolean logic
- turning questions into booleans (operators and comparisons)

- checking age

## Branching flow with if statements

- how if statements work and chaining them together
- is a number even or odd?

# FizzBuzz exercise

Write a function that returns the following, given the param passed in is a positive integer: for multiples of three, print "Fizz", for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". For all other numbers print (console.log) the number

```
function fizzBuzz(num) {
  if ()
}

fizzBuzz(3) // Fizz
fizzBuzz(5) // Buzz
fizzBuzz(15) // FizzBuzz
fizzBuzz(2) // 2

```
