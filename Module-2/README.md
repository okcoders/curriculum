<!--
    Rough breakdown of new Beta JS DS&A certification:
    21 'courses'
    5 'certification projects'
    The stuff in project chunks 4 and 5 is more dense/abstract and I assume will take more time.
    To me then it makes sense to try and get through projects 1-3 in module 2,
    and then do 4-5 and the more in depth coffee shop stuff in module 3
