    <h1>Tim Berners-Lee</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>

    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <div class="section-border-class">
        <p>Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Berners-Lee and Conway Berners-Lee. His parents were both from Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of ecology and climate change management.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.</p>
        <p>In 1976, Berners-Lee took a first in physics from The Queen's College, Oxford. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.</p>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <div class="section-border-class">
        <p>After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>

    <h2>Invention of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <div class="section-border-class">
        <p>Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent development.</p>
        <p>His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN httpd.</p>
        <p>Berners-Lee published the first website, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.</p>

    <h2>World Wide Web Consortium</h2>
    <div class="section-border-class">
        <p>In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due.</p>
        <p>He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Later Work</h2>
    <div class="section-border-class">
        <p>Berners-Lee holds the founders chair in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he heads the Decentralized Information Group and is leading Solid, a joint project with the Qatar Computing Research Institute that aims to radically change the way Web applications work, resulting in true data ownership and greater privacy.</p>
        <p>In 2016, he joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University as a professorial research fellow and as a fellow of Christ Church.</p>
        <p>On 30 September 2018, Berners-Lee announced his open-source startup Inrupt to fuel a commercial ecosystem around the Solid project.</p>
