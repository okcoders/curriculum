# Module 1 - Day 4

## Replicating Contact Form

We will be replicating https://elementalcoffee.com/contact/ in your groups

#### Steps:

1. **Examine the Original Page:**
   - First, visit [Elemental Coffee's Contact Page](https://elementalcoffee.com/contact/).
   - Notice the layout, including the navigation bar, the main section with the form, and the footer.
   - Pay attention to the colors, fonts, and spacing.

2. **Set Up Your Project:**
   - Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `elementalcoffee-replica`).
   - Inside that folder, create two files: `index.html` and `style.css`.

3. **Write the HTML Structure:**
   - Start with `index.html`.
   - Add the basic HTML document structure (doctype, html, head, body).
   - Include a link to your CSS file within the `<head>` tag.
   - Structure your HTML to include a header (for navigation), main section (for the contact form), and footer.

4. **Add Navigation:**
   - In the header section, create a simple navigation bar. You can use `<nav>` and `<ul>` elements.
   - List the items you find on the Elemental Coffee contact page but link them to `#` since this is a replica.

5. **Create the Contact Form:**
   - In the main section, add a `<form>` element.
   - Include input fields for name, email, and message, similar to the original. Use the `<input>` and `<textarea>` tags.
   - Add a submit button with `<input type="submit">` or `<button>` tag.

6. **Style Your Page with CSS:**
   - Open `style.css`.
   - Define the styles for your page. Start with the body's background color, font family, and text color.
   - Style the navigation bar, including hover effects for links.
   - Style the form to closely match the original. Pay attention to padding, margins, and the layout.

7. **Review and Refine:**
   - Compare your version with the original page. Make adjustments as needed to get closer to the original design.
   - Check the responsiveness and ensure the form is visually appealing and functional on different devices.
   - Adjust the layout and font sizes based on the screen size.

8. **Present Your Work:**
   - Show your work to your group members.
   - Discuss the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

#### Additional Tips:
- Use the browser's developer tools (Right-click > Inspect) to see the original site's HTML and CSS. This can give you hints about how certain styles are achieved.
- Don't worry about making it perfect. The goal is to practice and learn.
