## Goal of OKCoders

- To help the code-curious go a little bit deeper, with minimal commitment of time and money
- To connect the code-curious to mentors and other learners
- To connect the code-curious with other resources in the Oklahoma community
- To provide structure to other online coding resources

## OKCoders teaches the following technologies

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

We love other technologies, but we have found this stack (a selection of different tech to solve a problem, e.g make a web app) to be a great way to get going.
