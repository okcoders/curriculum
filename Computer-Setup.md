# Modules 1 & 2

- install vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- once installed add the live server extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
  mac/windows: in vscode click the extensions tab on the far left, search live server, and install
- Install the google chrome web browser - we all need to use the same web browser so that we are using the same browser developer tools
- if you have trouble with any of the above, you can work with a mentor on day 1 to get setup
