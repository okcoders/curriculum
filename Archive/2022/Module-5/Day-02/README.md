# Day 2

- what is express
- running our custom express template
- adding routes to our express app (a library/goodreads clone))
  - we will use a service that will "hand-wave" saving our data for us
  - get routes
    - all books
    - book by id
    - search for book by title
  - post routes
    - post body
    - create new book
  - put routes
    - put body
    - update a book
    - mark as being read
  - delete routes

## If we still have time

Create frontend to hit our new routes

GET /books
GET /books/:id
GET /books with search query
POST /books
PUT /books
PUT /books/mark-read
DELETE /books/:id
