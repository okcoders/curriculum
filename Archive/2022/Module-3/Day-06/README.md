# Day 6 - High Level Overview

## Warm-up

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((n) => <implement your code here>)
```

## New concepts thrown at you all (tricky stuff):

- node (server-side js, e.g non-browser based js)
- command line (terminal)
- async (short for asynchronous) and promises
- http
- restful urls
- json
- api, this is one of the most overused words in programming
  - server (the url and resources you can get)
  - code api (methods and properties available on a js array)
- documentation

## Where we are and where we are going:

- database and apis (servers)
- modern front-ends with react

## Our two challenges

### weather

- the weather api, is a server! We are integrating with it in order to display the context to a typical user.

### posts

- the dummy api is a server! We can also talk to that with node. For this exercise, you can think of it more like an analytics project.
