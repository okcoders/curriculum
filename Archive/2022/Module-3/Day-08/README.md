# Day 08

## Warm-up

- open ubuntu (windows) or the terminal (mac)
- what command do you use to find out what directory you are currently in?
- what command do you use to list the contents of the current directory?
- what command do you use to change directory?
- how do you change directory to "go back" - e.g from /User/zach/code/ok-coders -> /User/zach/code
- what command do you use to go to your home directory?

## Why do we need the command line?

- for front-end - we use command line to run and manage our front-end projects (e.g react project)
- for back-end - we use command line to run and manage our back-end projects (tasks or servers)

Typical example of command line usage for a project:

- move to where your project is in the terminal
- run a command to run the project in "development mode"
- run a command to open the project in a code editor
- once done writing code, stop the project from running
- save and push your changes with git

## A quick note on the node project

- why would we use node over the browser?
- In the case of the weather api, we may want to do some data analytics, or store and collect weather information, or send emails about the weather, or automate something based on the weather - none of that would happen in the browser

## React Preview

- creating react project
- weather api in it
