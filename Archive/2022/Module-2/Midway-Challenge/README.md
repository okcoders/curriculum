# Challenge

You should expect to look things up by googling, reading documentation, and referencing prior lesson code.

# Instructions

You are creating an online garage sale. Pick 6 items you would like to sell, and create a site that shows off those 6 things, and allows someone to "buy" them.

- create a new html page
- create a template for each thing you will sell. At minimum, have a name and a price for the thing being sold. You can also include an image of the item. You will also need a button that says "add to cart" in the template
- use this template to populate your site with your 6 items (perhaps in a 3x3 grid)
- hook up the buttons, so that when the user clicks on them, that item is added to their cart.
- bonus: if an item is in the cart, the button text should change to "remove from cart", and clicking the button should then remove that item
- Add a checkout button
- When clicking the checkout button, the page should be updated to show how many items they have in their cart, and the total price.
