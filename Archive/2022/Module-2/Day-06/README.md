# warm-up

- copy this file to your own file: [warm up template](./warm-up-template.html)
- create a new function that takes a string as a parameter, and then returns a message which shows the original string passed in, along with the length (number of characters in the string)
- take the name that the user inputs, and whenever the submit button is clicked, log to the console the result of passing the name to the above function you created (e.g the length of the persons name is printed)
- bonus, figure out how to clear the input field whenever submit is clicked, this documentation will help: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text
