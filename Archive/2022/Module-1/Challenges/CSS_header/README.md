# Challenge 2

## Make the following header using HTML and CSS
Using the header_finish image included, re-create this header using both HTML and CSS.
Once complete, if you have time, learn how to make the buttons turn to navy when you hover your mouse over it. 

- index.html is the solution html file
- style.css is the solution css file
- mackbok.jpg is a picture to use for your header

You can download the entire 'CSS_header' file and open it in VS Code in order to view and/or play with it.

Note: The text in the paragraph in the picture is just filler text that Visual Stuido Code will automatially add in if you start typing "Lorem" 
and then press enter. Developers will use this just for placeholder text while designing before adding in real content.
