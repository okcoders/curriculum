# Day 08

## Testing

We'll start my creating a classic FizzBuzz application (was a common test question for new developers during interviews.)  We will turn that application into a module, and instead call that module from our index.js application.

Then we will use Jest to create tests for our module, and uncover some issues with the module as it is defined.

Finally, if we have time we will setup a github action that will automatically run our test script whenever we push to github.
