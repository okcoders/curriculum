# Day 01

-   what is react and why was it made
    -   Explain the DOM
    -   don't have to worry about refreshing page, or how to do that efficiently
    -   just focus on the data you are capturing and how you want the page to look based on that state
    -   great developer experience
-   using create-react-app to start a new project from scratch
    -   `npx create-react-app my-app`
-   simple static site in react, with multiple components
    -   App.jsx
        -   Header.jsx
        -   Body.jsx
            -   Pokemon.jsx
-   we will be using hooks only, and will be ignoring class based components
