## Prework for day 1:
    - SLAY THE DRAGON! Work through `Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game` to the best of your ability. Asking for help, all the internet/AI you want to use is fair game for this one, even peeking at future steps to see the 'answer' is fine. If you aren't able to make it all the way through before we start on Wednesday that's ok too. The intent here is to review some HTML/CSS from module 1 and expose you to the basics of making it interactive. There's a lot of new words, terms, and concepts and this is meant to be treated as a first overview / exposure for you. It is not expected that you fully understand all the concepts introduced or even all of the syntax, so it's not cheating on this one to keep going forward to fight the dragon any way you can. Think about reading the code more than worrying about writing it. We will spend the whole module diving into all the concepts that are introduced in this first project. 

## Class 1
    - ### High level overview, much of the code today should not be understood and will be covered in more detail later
    - order in html vs. css vs. js
    - responsibilities of each
    - js is for adding event handling and dynamic content to html
    - what are some examples of dynamic content or events?
    - connecting and adding scripts to html
    - the console
    - do something or store something per line (multi-line later)
    - program execution
    - the debugger (super high level)
    - variables, types, and operators
    - when we are in the browser, there are all sorts of apis available to us: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API - we interact with these with javascript
    - for example, we can prompt, and we can get elements on the page to update
    - Node/Deno/Bun (just that it exists - the idea of a runtime for JS vs browser runtime)
