## Class Overview and value proposition

    - 5 Modules + capstone
    - slack, and github are main resource hubs
    - we mirror free-code-camp and other online curriculums
    - main benefit is access to teacher and mentors, and more importantly connection to other students and techlahoma community members
    - lecture + group work (3 lectures, then 4 hour+ in-class work day)
    - we are a part-time introduction bootcamp - getting a job after only doing this bootcamp is not something you should expect (though it is possible)

## Teacher intros, Mentor intros

## Class intros

## Break into teams

## Expectations

    - you will need to prove you did homework to get a certificate (by pushing to github)
    - must make 80% of classes
    - should spend ~4 hours each week on homework
