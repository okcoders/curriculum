# Module 1 - Day 7: Positioning and Multi Page Setup

## Positioning

### Basics of Positioning

-   Important Types of Positioning
    -   Static (the default): unaffected by directional properties
    -   Relative (positioned relative to it's normal position): affected by directional properties
    -   Fixed (positioned relative to the viewport): Does not leave a gap where it would normally have been located
    -   Absolute (positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor): removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
    -   Sticky (positioned based on the user's scroll position): toggles between relative and fixed

## Multi Page Setup

-   Use `a` tags to link to other html files (shared html code will need to be duplicated)
