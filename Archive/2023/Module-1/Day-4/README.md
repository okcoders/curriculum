# Module 1 - Day 4

## Replicating Contact Form

We will be replicating https://elementalcoffee.com/contact/ in your groups

### Step 1

Build out the Header

-   You don't need to create the navbar or the header
-   You can use any image for your header (something like unsplash will be a great resource)

### Step 2

Create contact form

-   This will not need to be functional
-   Just focus on matching the styles.
-   It should be centered within the page

### Step 3

Create the Footer

-   The links in the navigation don't have to lead anywhere. For now just make them blank
-   The icons in the connect section can be found using a icon library (font-awesome is a great resource for this)

### Step 4

-   Bonus!
-   Create the Back-To-Top button and give it a fixed position in the bottom right corner
-   Don't worry about hiding and showing this button right now
