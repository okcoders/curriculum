## Coffee Shop 2.0!

You are building a coffee shop website for a local coffee shop. The coffee shop has a menu of items that they sell. The coffee shop also has a shopping cart that the user can add items to. The coffee shop also has a login system that allows the user to login with their name.

You should use html, css, and plain js all in the same file. You should not use any libraries or frameworks.

Below are the instructions for the coffee shop website. You should follow the instructions and build the website.

Please reply with only the code for the site, do not explain it.

This code should be as simple as possible and should not use advanced things like looping or map

### Prompt based login

- on initial load of the app, there should be a button at the top right of the nav bar that says login
- when the user clicks the login button, a prompt should appear asking for their name
- the user should then type their full name into the prompt (first name last name separated by a space)
- once the user has typed their name into the prompt, the prompt should close and the user should be logged in
- the login button should be gone and should now be replaced with the users avatar string (e.g. "JS" for "John Smith")

### Adding Items to the Shopping Cart

- add click handlers to all the items on your menu (this can be a button or on the whole item card)
- when the user clicks on an item, it should be added to the shopping cart
- the shopping cart should update and have the current number of items in the cart
- the shopping cart should also update and have the current total price of all items in the cart

### Removing Items from the Shopping Cart

- if an item is in the shopping cart, there should be a button next to it that says "remove"
- when the user clicks the remove button, the item should be removed from the shopping cart
- the total # of items should be updated and the total price should be updated
