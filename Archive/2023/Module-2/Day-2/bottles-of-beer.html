<!-- write a full html file that solves the following it should use a script tag for
all javascript all javascript should be plain js prompt the user on page load
for a number to start with once you have the number from them, write in a
<p>
  that many bottles of beer on the wall (e.g. 99 bottles of beer on the wall
  should be on the screen if they input 99) add a button that says "take one
  down" after clicking that button, the number of bottles should go down by one,
  and you should add that new sentence to the page. You should not replace the
  sentence, but append a new one the button should still be there, and clicking
  it should continue to decrement the number of bottles you should use an event
  listener for the button rather than the button onclick property -->
