# Day 5 - HW

## Introduction:

In this project, you will be utilizing your knowledge of MaterialUI to create a React project related to any topic you like. The primary objective is to reinforce your understanding of how to interact with various MaterialUI components and implement responsiveness. Additionally, you will learn how to apply a custom theme to your components, enhancing their visual appeal and consistency.

## Requirements:

1.  Set up the project:
    -   Create a new React project using the tool of your choice (e.g., Create React App).
    -   Ensure that MaterialUI is installed in your project by running the necessary commands (e.g., npm install @mui/material).
2.  Choose a topic:
    -   Select a topic for your project that interests you (e.g., Recipe app, Fitness tracker, Movie database, Weather app, etc.). This will provide context for the components you will create.
3.  Create responsive components:
    -   Design and implement at least five different MaterialUI components, chosen based on their relevance to your chosen topic. Examples include:
        -   Appbar
        -   Buttons (with different variants)
        -   Typography (to display titles, subtitles, or descriptions)
        -   Grids (to structure your app's layout)
        -   Cards (to display data or information)
        -   Inputs (text fields, select fields, etc.)
        -   Icons (from @mui/icons-material)
    -   Ensure that each component is responsive by adapting its size, layout, or behavior based on different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
4.  Implement a theme:
    -   Define a custom theme using the MUI theme provider, designed to match the overall aesthetics and branding of your topic.
5.  Integrate components into your project:
    -   Use React's component-based approach to structure your project.
    -   Create relevant pages or sections in your project where you can showcase and utilize the MaterialUI components you have developed.
6.  Test and refine: - Test your project across different devices and screen resolutions to ensure proper responsiveness and behavior.

## Conclusion:

    By following these instructions, you will gain hands-on experience in creating responsive components using MaterialUI within a customized theme. This project will help you solidify your understanding of MaterialUI's various components and reinforce your ability to create visually engaging and responsive user interfaces.
