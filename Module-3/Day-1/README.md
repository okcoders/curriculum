# Class 01

## Command Line

Why do you need to learn the command line?
- command line interfaces come first because GUIs are harder to make and take more time
- you can do things faster from the command line once you learn it

- [GitBash -For Widows Users](https://gitforwindows.org/)

### Commands:

- ls
- man
- pwd
- mkdir
- touch
- mv
- cp
- cat
- | and grep
- command [flags] argument
- redirection (echo "# 2019-javascript-2" >> README.md)

## What is a tech Stack?

A "stack" in software development language is the basic list of tools you use for full development,
sometimes called full stack development.

- Programming Language
- Frontend Framework
- Backend Framework
- Database Engine

OKCoders is opinionated (meaning we select 1 stack and only teach you that), so that you can learn
to do "full stack development."  Our stack is a MERN stack:

- MongoDB (Database)
- Express (Backend Framework)
- React (Frontend Framework)
- Node.js (Programming Language)

Other common development stacks are MEAN, LAMP, and Windows...

## Node

Node is an ecosystem for writing server side javascript.

## Git/Github

Git is the most common version control software used in application development.  It is used
to coordinate the activity of multiple developers on the same project, track software changes,
resolve change conflict, and automate testing/deployment.

Github is a popular Git hosting service for both open source project and company source control.
