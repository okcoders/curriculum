## Testing

In software development we are generally talking about 3 kinds of testing

* Unit Testing - Done to test "blocks" of code are working as expected, and failing as expected
* Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different parts of the system.
* E2E Testing - Automated full system testing (log into site, click through forms, submit new thing... etc.)
