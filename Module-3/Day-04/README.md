# Warm-Up

add the below code to a node script. Fix all the bugs so the program logs "Good morning sunshine!" to the console.

```
function mainEntryPoint(modifier) {
    let message = "Good morning "
    message += `&{modifier}!`
    console.log(message)
]

mainEntryPiont("sunshin')
```

# new concepts

- console.log a bunch to see how the execution of a program is unfolding
- read the error, then go to the code
- how to read a stack trace
- Promises + async/await
- APIs and docs

# exercise

Continue to work on the license program, but create the bugs below while doing it.

- interactively code bugs and see if students can help figure them out
- misspell require
- miss closing bracket of higher order rocket function
- mix template string with single quote
