## Node

Node actually does two things for us that are pretty fundamental to backend development

* Local JS Interpreter
* A Package Manager (npm)

We can interact with the node interpreter either by running it against js files or through the Node REPL.

## Git/Github

You need to be uploading all your work to github going forward!
