# Day 04

We are going to use npm/npx to run a local web server to host your spreadsheet.
The module we are using is `live-server` and it includes auto-refresh.

## Setup

We will use npx to temporarily download and run so we don't have to install it. 
npx is a run once tool for npm

In your local project folder run:

npx live-server

Now just open web broswer to:

http://127.0.0.1:8080
